- **Role-Based Access**: Admin and trainee roles with different permissions
- **Security**: HTTP-only cookies with secure flags

### User Management
- **Admin Users**: System administrators with full access
- **Trainee Users**: Students with limited access to their own data
- **Registration Flow**: Multi-step registration with email verification
- **Profile Management**: Automated assignment of training details (room, venue, etc.)

### Content Management
- **Training Materials**: Video content, documents, and resources
- **Progress Tracking**: Individual trainee progress monitoring
- **Announcements**: System-wide and sponsor-specific notifications
- **Assignments**: Task management and submission tracking

### Data Models
- **Users**: Core user authentication and profile data
- **Sponsors**: Organizations sponsoring trainee batches
- **Trainees**: Extended user profiles with training-specific information
- **Content**: Training materials and resources
- **Progress**: Individual trainee progress and completion tracking
- **Announcements**: System notifications and updates

## Data Flow

### Registration Process
1. User accesses landing page
2. Admin enables/disables registration via system settings
3. Multi-step registration: email/password → verification → personal details
4. Automatic assignment of training logistics (room, venue, meal location)
5. Email verification before account activation

### Authentication Flow
1. User clicks login → redirected to Replit Auth
2. Successful authentication creates/updates user session
3. Role-based redirection (admin → admin dashboard, trainee → trainee dashboard)
4. Session persistence with PostgreSQL backing

### Content Delivery
1. Content filtered by sponsor association
2. Progress tracking for individual trainees
3. Real-time updates via React Query
4. Optimistic updates for better UX
