### 🔶 **6. System Logic & Automation Rules**

* Room, Lecture Venue, Meal Venue should be auto-distributed evenly or randomly.
* Tag Number is auto-generated and unique per trainee (e.g., "FAMS-0091").
* No sponsor selection is available to users — it's defined by admin settings.
* Trainees only see content (videos, quizzes, messages) assigned by the admin to their sponsor’s batch.
* System must show sponsor name/logo on every screen a trainee interacts with.
* Registration should close if admin disables it — and the Register button becomes inactive with a clear notice.

---

### 🔶 **7. Access Types & Permissions**

* **Trainees**: Can view only their own dashboard and complete assigned tasks.
* **Admin**: Full control of users, sponsors, content, system settings.
* **Optional (Future)**: Sub-admins per region/sponsor.

---

### 🔶 **8. System Expectations**

* All activities (quiz scores, uploads) should be saved and associated with both trainee and sponsor.
* Sponsor-specific reporting system for admin to analyze participation and results.
* Email notifications to trainees (optional) for assignments, results, or announcements.
* Fully responsive design for both mobile and desktop users.
